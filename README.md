DRC-Backup
==========

A reliable and simple command line backup utility for windows

I have used this for a number of years to backup small networks reliably and to provide notification of the backup status via email and texting.

A command prompt user interface for configuration was started, but never completed so use the backup.ini to configure the software for your environment.
