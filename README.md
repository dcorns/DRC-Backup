DRC-Backup
==========

A reliable and simple command line backup utility for windows

I have used this for a number of years to backup small networks reliably and to provide notification of the backup status via email and texting.

A command prompt user interface for configuration was started, but never completed so use the DrcBackupSys.ini file to configure the software for your environment.

The code is pretty easy to follow, but I will add and overview when time permits.
